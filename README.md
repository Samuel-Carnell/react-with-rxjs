# ReactXJS

ReactXJS provides a collection of hooks for creating and consuming RXJS observables within react components.

## Installation

To install ReactXJS run either of the following comments. Note that this library also requires both react and rxjs to be installed as peer dependencies.

NPM -

```bash
npm install reactxjs
```

Yarn -

```bash
yarn add reactxjs
```

## Usage

## Motivation

RxJS is a fantastic library for writing complex asynchronous logic. Whilst it is typically used within angular projects, it can be used with any frontend framework. Ultimately ReactXJS is designed to bridge the gap between RxJS' observable sequences and React's component lifecycle.
